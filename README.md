A set of demos to illustrate various design patterns.

Developed in IntelliJ with each example in a separate Module.

So far there are demos for:
    Observer
    Singleton
    Factory

NOTE that the Observer an Observable classes were deprecated at Java 9.  The recommended way to implement the Observer pattern is now to use a PropertyChangeSupport instance.  A new demo has been added to show this called "PropertyChangeSupportDemo".
